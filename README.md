# trees

The project is for Education purposes.
Anyone interested in learning about different types of trees, applications, sample codes can refer to this guide.
The idea is to have a one stop repository for personal learning and knowledge gathering.

A lot of the code and style is insprired from other education websites like GeeksForGeeks.org, LeetCode.com etc. as they personally have been great tutors for CSE learners.

The code is written in Python primarily to serve as a learning for new beginners.
Feel free to contribute to the code.
